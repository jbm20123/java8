JDK stands for java development kit.It is a dependent platform
here the word "DEPENDENT" mean that when we will go to install the JDK it asks for which OS we want to install for e.g. windows,solaris,macos,linux etc
That means as JDK is dependent platform if it will be independent then it shouldnt ask for os at the time of installation.
it is responsible to convert the java programs to byte code.

JRE stands for java run environment.it resides inside the JDK file.
In JRE file javac.exe and java.exe file resides.
JRE is also a dependent platform.

JVM is java virtual machine.JVM resides inside the JRE file.
JVM is responsible for translate byte code to machine code.
it is also a dependent platform that makes the java independent.

Interpreter is called as just-in-time compiler.
interpreter does three work-:
1.read the code
2.convert the byte code to machine code3.execute the code
the difference between compiler and interpreter is-:
interpreter read and execute the code line by line while compiler first read the whole codeand execute it in one time

.class file or byte code is independent platform.it is generated when we compile the code in java source file is converted into .class file or byte code
